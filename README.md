## This Privacy Policy covers the privacy practices Starkode employs when Starkode customers (“Customers”) use our Cloud-Based Enterprise Applications (the “Service”). This Privacy Policy does not cover any information or data collected by Starkode for other purposes, such as information collected for marketing purposes.

Personal Information
In the normal course of using the Starkode Service, Customers will input electronic data into the Starkode systems (“Customer Data”). The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Customer has engaged Starkode. Starkode may access Customer Data for the purposes of providing the Service, preventing or addressing service or technical problems, responding to support issues, responding to Customer’s instructions or as may be required by law, in accordance with the relevant agreement between Customer and Starkode. Starkode processes Customer Data under the direction of its Customers, and has no direct control or ownership of the personal data it processes. Customers are responsible for complying with any regulations or laws that require providing notice, disclosure and/or obtaining consent prior to transferring the data to Starkode for processing purposes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct his or her query to the Starkode Customer. If the Customer requests Starkode to remove the personal data to comply with data protection regulations, Starkode will respond to their request within 30 business days. Starkode will refer any request for disclosure of personal data by a law enforcement authority to the Customer. Starkode may, where it concludes that it is legally obligated to do so, disclose personal data to law enforcement or other government authorities. Starkode will notify Customer of such request unless prohibited by law.


Accessing the Service
Customers and their authorized users may access the Service directly through mobile application or via web to their individual tenant, or may elect to use internal launch pages for single sign on or other purposes. Customers input information for processing and storage as they use the Service. Customers may also configure the Service to allow end users to input information directly into the Service.


Data Retention
Starkode retains Customer Data according to the timeframes set forth in the relevant agreement with its Customers.


Security
The security of Customer Data, including personal data, is very important to Starkode. Starkode maintains a comprehensive, written information security program that contains industry standard, administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access to Customer Data. Starkode designs its applications to allow Customers to achieve differentiated configurations, enforce user access controls, and manage data categories that may be populated and/or made accessible on a device-by-device basis. Configuring these settings appropriately is the Customer’s responsibility. Additional information about the security settings and configurations can be found in the Starkode Documentation made available to Customers.

We reserve the right to change or update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes to the Privacy Policy will be posted on this website and links to the Privacy Policy will indicate that the policy has been changed or updated. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy for any changes. For new Customers, changes or updates are effective upon posting. For existing Customers, changes or updates are effective 30 days after posting.
